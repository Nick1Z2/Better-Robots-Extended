---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.18
Date: 2025-12-09
  Changes:
    - The automatic recipe detection system has been expanded to include Roboports. BRE Roboport MK1 is now only generated when another mod modifies the vanilla Roboport recipe or when the “Override” option is enabled.
    - BRE Roboport MK2 and MK3 are always loaded, but no longer reference the vanilla Roboport. They now inherit from BRE-Roboport-MK1 instead of using a direct deepcopy. (Improves mod compatibility and ensures stable prototype values.)
  Bugfixes:
    - Roboport prototypes now use a dedicated BRE base definition rather than copying the vanilla Roboport. This prevents issues caused by other mods modifying or hiding the vanilla prototype (e.g., Bob’s Logistics).
    - The vanilla Roboport is no longer part of any upgrade chain. This prevents Factorio errors when other mods hide the vanilla Roboport item while upgrade chains are still active.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.17
Date: 2025-12-07
  Changes:
    - Expanded the existing MK1 robot setting: instead of a simple on/off toggle, players can now choose between Auto, Disable, and Override modes for more precise control over when BRE MK1 robots are enabled.
    - Updated locale text to reflect the new selectable modes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.16
Date: 2025-12-07
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed the base recipe requirements used for comparison against vanilla robot recipes.
      The wrong ingredient sets were being checked, which caused the mod to mis-detect whether a recipe had been modified.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.15
Date: 2025-12-07
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed BRE roboport MK2/MK3 charging robots even when not connected to the power grid. Their energy source now correctly starts empty and requires power before charging any bots.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.14
Date: 2025-12-06
  Changes:
    - Improved recipe detection system to correctly identify modified construction-robot and logistic-robot base recipes when used with Bob’s Mods and other overhauls.
    - MK1 robot recipes are now generated only after final data stage to ensure full compatibility with mods that patch vanilla robots in data-updates and data-final-fixes.
    - Unified MK1 recipe loading to prevent duplicate registration and improve stability.
    - Added safety check preventing MK1 generation when base recipes remain unmodified (unless forced through mod setting).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.13
Date: 2025-09-21 
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed Logistic Robot MK5 animation: in_motion sprite dimensions/offsets were mismatched. Now aligned with the cargo animation (80×84 frames, proper row offset). Flying animation without cargo now displays correctly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.12
Date: 2025-06-15 
  Changelog:
    - Adjusted hatch alignment on Mk2 and Mk3 roboports to ensure correct visual positioning.
    - Minor tweak to base_patch offset for better sprite consistency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.11  
Date: 2025-06-14  
  Changelog:
    - Fixed: Charging port hatch now uses a custom sprite instead of the vanilla one,
             preventing visual misalignment caused by other mods (e.g. Bob's Mods).
    - Minor visual cleanup on Mk2 and Mk3 roboports to ensure consistent appearance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.10
Date: 2025-04-01
  Changelog:
    - Added new battery research levels from 1 to 18.
    - Battery research now dynamically integrates optional science packs based on existing mod settings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.8
Date: 2025-01-29
  Features:
    - New setting "Disables Bobs bots" Disables Bob's bots and Roboports along with their associated research.
    - New setting "Forces a recipe for MK1 bots" Adds an additional recipe for MK1 bots and Roboports based on base-game specifications and places them in the regular category.
    - If "Forces a recipe for MK1 bots" is enabled, a second recipe for logistic-robot, construction-robot, and Roboports is added based on base-game specifications, as the original recipes from Bob's Mods are altered and cannot be easily reverted.
    - If "Forces a recipe for MK1 bots" is enabled, the recipes for MK1 bots and Roboports are unlocked through research.
    - Fixed the order of logistic bots and construction bots, and Roboports so that MK1 appears first, followed by MK2, MK3, MK4, and MK5.
